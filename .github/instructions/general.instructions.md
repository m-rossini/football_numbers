My development process is:
 1. I discuss and plan with you
 1. For each feature:
    1. I write tests failing tests
    1. I implement the feature
    1. I run the tests to verify the feature works as intended
    1. I refactor the code if necessary
 1. I repeat step 2 until all features are implemented
  1. I do a final review and testing of the entire codebase
  1. I deliver the final code to you

When writing code, I follow these principles:
 - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
 - Prefer readablility over cleverness
 - Follow best practices and coding standards for the language
 - Prefer simplicity and clarity in design
 - Write modular and reusable code
 - Avoid premature optimization
 - Never permit global state 
 - Avoid stupid and useless comments
 - Tests must be signifitve and no test details, they should be a documentation on how to use the code
 - Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
 - Handle errors gracefully and provide useful error messages
