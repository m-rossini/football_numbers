# Specs

## Requiremetents
1. I want to create a scafollding web app:
 1. It goes in the correct directory
 1. Browser shows user and hsotname of the machine where it runs, be concerned with linux only

## Contraints
1. It must be type script
1. It must be mapped to dev contianer in the way it can run from the contianer
1. Since it runs in the container the port must be exposed

## Success Criteria and Verifications
1. Ensure it runs and responds to a specific route/endpoint with some sort of heart bit, maybe the wall time in which it is up and running
